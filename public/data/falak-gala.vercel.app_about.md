# About Me

My journey into coding began back in 2016, when I was a 14-year-old introduced to Java and C++. Like most students at the time, I didn't really understand what I was doing—I would memorize programs like Hello World, Fibonacci series, and Palindrome checkers just to get through exams. But every time a program ran successfully, it sparked a sense of excitement and curiosity in me. That early spark led me to pursue a Diploma in Computer Engineering, where I finally began to understand how computers and networks actually worked.

In July 2022, I took my first real step into web development by building two educational websites using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and SCSS. I even hosted them by dragging and dropping files directly into GitHub—looking back, it’s funny how scrappy that process was, but it marked a turning point in my learning.

Soon after, I landed an internship at a startup in January 2023, where I worked for 7 months. It was my first exposure to real-world software development, and I learned a lot just by observing how actual systems were built and shipped (more on that in the experience section). After the internship, I spent the next year alongside college diving deep into self-learning—exploring modern tech stacks, improving my fundamentals, and building projects that helped me grow as a developer.

In July 2024, I rejoined the same startup—this time as a Software Engineer —leading teams and building production-grade AI products. Despite the progress and experience, I still approach coding with the same enthusiasm I had when I first got curious about Hello World. I continue to code almost every day, and building beautiful, meaningful user interfaces has become one of the most fulfilling parts of my journey.
