Like most students at the time, I didn't really understand what I was doing—I would memorize programs like `Hello World`, `Fibonacci series`, and `Palindrome checkers` just to get through exams. But every time a program ran successfully, it sparked a sense of excitement and curiosity in me. That early spark led me to pursue a Diploma in Computer Engineering, where I finally began to understand how computers and networks actually worked."

I even hosted them by dragging and dropping files directly into GitHub—looking back, it’s funny how scrappy that process was, but it marked a turning point in my learning."

It was my first exposure to real-world software development, and I learned a lot just by observing how actual systems were built and shipped (more on that in the `experience section`). After the internship, I spent the next year alongside college diving deep into self-learning—exploring modern tech stacks, improving my fundamentals, and building projects that helped me grow as a developer."

Despite the progress and experience, I still approach coding with the same enthusiasm I had when I first got curious about `Hello World`. I continue to code almost every day, and building beautiful, meaningful user interfaces has become one of the most fulfilling parts of my journey."
